# SymbolicFuzzer

A basic fuzzer based on paper "Automated Whitebox Fuzz Testing".

### Execution Environment

* OS: Linux
* Python: 2.7.12
* Angr: 7.7.9.21

### Run the Fuzzer

```
$ cd source
$ python fuzzer.py <config file> <output file>
# eg.: python fuzzer.py targets/assert.fz assert.out 
```

### Config File Format

```
<relative binary path>
<n: number of command line arguments>
<n space separated positive integers denoting the max size in bytes for each command line argument. string ending '\0' included>
<max size in bytes for standard input>
<max depth/number of branches to explore in a path>
<overall time limit in seconds>
```

example:

```
fauxware
3
2 2 2
30
10
10
```

### Output File Format

Content of the output file is generated by the fuzzer. It contains 0 or more lines. Each line is a record, representing a potential bug in the target binary where the binary does not exit with a status 0.
Each record is of format: `[return_status, [command_line_arguments...], [standard_input...]]`
